# MINI PROJECT: MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION

Music genre classification is a significant task in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), aiming to automatically categorize music tracks into predefined genres. This task is vital for various applications, including music recommendation systems, content organization, and personalized playlists.

## GTZAN Dataset

The GTZAN dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for music genre classification tasks. It contains 1,000 audio excerpts, each 30 seconds long, categorized into 10 distinct genres, including Blues, Rock, Jazz, Classical, and more. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating music genre classification models.

## Features Extraction

To perform music genre classification, three different classification models were compared:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Simple Neural Network with the Adam Optimization Algorithm
The accuracy of these models was evaluated to determine their effectiveness in classifying music tracks into their respective genres. This comparison helps in identifying the most suitable model for the classification task.

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as librosa, IPython, and any other dependencies required for audio processing and machine learning tasks.
2. Data Preparation, ensure that you have the correct path. 
3. Train the SVM, KNN and Simple Neural Network model using the preprocessed dataset.
